<p>The Genomic Standards Consortium will convene its 23rd meeting in Bangkok, Thailand (GSC23-Bangkok) on August 7-11, 2023, with the  Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital at <a href="https://www2.si.mahidol.ac.th/en/" target=_blank>Mahidol University</a> and the (<a href="http://www.biotec.or.th/en/" target=_blank>National Center for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology (BIOTEC/NSTDA)</a>), with a hybrid (in person/remote) agenda. </p>
<br>
<p>This Genomic Standards Consortium Meeting was originally planned as GSC22 to take place in 2020, however as with most things in 2020, it was postponed.</p>
<p>GSC23 sessions will focus on tackling metadata challenges related to the sample collection, processing and genomic sequencing workflow critical for small and large scale datasets within the fields of;
<ul>
<li>Medical genomics</li>
<li>Agriculture</li>
<li>Comparative genomics</li>
<li>Metabolomics</li>
</ul>
Tackling metadata challenges related to the sample collection, processing and genomic sequencing workflow critical for small and large scale datasets. It is our intention to discuss and plan for evolving genomic and laboratory standards to address the needs of the clinical, academic and industry researchers with a focus on precision medicine and agriculture. </p>
<br>
<p>The GSC consists of international delegates working in collaborative groups to provide a forum for implementing community-driven standards and related protocols. Participants in the GSC include biologists, computer scientists, those building genomic databases and conducting large-scale comparative genomic analyses, and those with experience of building community-based standards.  Since its founding in 2005, the GSC has had the following goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>The implementation of new genomic standards</li>
<li>Methods of capturing and exchanging metadata</li>
<li>Harmonization of metadata collection and analysis efforts across the wider genomics community</li>
<li>Standardizing critical protocols in all related genomic research</li>
</ul>
 <br>
<p>To accomplish these goals, the GSC works closely with leading corporations that develop and supply the technologies used by our members. The GSC invites your partnership in our organisation providing you with an opportunity to put your companyâ€™s trademark and products in front of these key industry professionals, who have a vested interest in your products. </p>
