<p>The Genomic Standards Consortium will convene GSC22 (Moorea), during the week of March 21-26, 2022, at the <a href="https://www.moorea.berkeley.edu/" target=_blank>Gump Station</a> and the Center for Insular Research and Observatory of the Environment (<a href="http://www.criobe.pf/sites/moorea/" target=_blank>CRIOBE</a>), with a hybrid (in person/remote) agenda. </p>

<p>Due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic travel restrictions and in order to limit exposure, the in-person meeting will be limited to 40 participants (invited speakers, GSC board members, sponsors, local attendees). The morning sessions will be telecast with remote participation via the GSC Slack (GSC22 channel). Registration for in-person attendees is anticipated to be $100 and virtual attendees will be free.</p>

<p>GSC-Moorea will focus on Genomic Standards, Biodiversity, Climate Change, and Human Health and is intended for professionals within the fields of medical genomics, biodiversity, environmental genomics and climate studies, microbiome and metagenomics related to the sample collection, processing and genomic sequencing workflow critical for small and large scale datasets. It is our intention to discuss and plan for evolving genomic and laboratory standards to address the needs of the clinical, academic and industry researchers with a focus on improving all genomic workflows related to human health and biodiversity.</p>

<p>The GSC consists of international delegates working in collaborative groups to provide a forum for implementing community-driven standards and related protocols. Participants in the GSC include biologists, computer scientists, those building genomic databases and conducting large-scale comparative genomic analyses, and those with experience of building community-based standards.  Since its founding in 2005, the GSC has had the following goals:</p>

* The implementation of new genomic standards<br>
* Methods of capturing and exchanging metadata<br>
* Harmonization of metadata collection and analysis efforts across the wider genomics community<br>
* Standardizing critical protocols in all related genomic research<br>
 
<p>To accomplish these goals, the GSC works closely with leading corporations that develop and supply the technologies used by our members. The GSC invites your partnership in our organisation providing you with an opportunity to put your company’s trademark & products in front of these key industry professionals, who have a vested interest in your products. </p>
