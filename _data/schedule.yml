FAIR has united stakeholders world-wide behind a common concept: good data management under common standards. It is no longer optional. However, the FAIR Principles are aspirational, and putting FAIR into practice is work in progress; it 'takes a village'! Starting with a brief history of the Principles, Susanna will paint the landscape of key initiatives and community activities for FAIR data, with a focus in the Life Science, including resources like FAIRsharing (https://fairsharing.org), and the FAIR Cookbook (https://faircookbook.elixir-europe.org)."

A major part of those efforts is the creation and use of GigaDB, the open access repository of datasets directly associated with all GigaScience journal articles. GigaDB datasets are created by the authors with expert guidance from highly experienced data curation staff, making use of relevant standards and ensuring deposition of all relevant data in public repositories. Our curation staff keep themselves abreast of many on-going standards efforts including the GSC MIxS as well as relevant ontologies, and guide authors on their appropriate use in dataset metadata. Here I will present GigaDB and highlight some of the ways we utilise standards in our curation work."

        abstract: "The gut microbiota plays an essential role in animal health and production, and its study has become increasingly important in the aquaculture sector. However, standard protocols and best practices for measuring shrimp microbiota are not well established, leading to uncertainty in the accuracy of results and complicating cross-study analyses.<br>In this study, we investigated the influence of key methodological variables on the gut microbiota profiles of black tiger shrimp, an important product of the aquaculture industry in Asia Pacific region. We used pooled gut samples and synthetic DNA spike-in standards to evaluate four commercial kits for DNA extraction with primer sets for the V1-V2, V3-V4, and V6-V8 hypervariable regions of the 16S rRNA gene. We evaluated the performance of the kits and PCR primers based on the diversity of observed microbiota profiles, taxon-specific biases, and accuracy of quantification of spike-in standards. We also evaluated different bioinformatics pipelines for data analysis, focusing on the advantages of using denoising algorithms compared to traditional clustering methods to resolve sequence diversity in dominant species.<br>Our results showed that the variables assessed had a significant impact on shrimp gut microbiota profiles. This highlights the need for standard protocols and best practice guidelines for measuring shrimp microbiota. Our study provides several recommendations to improve the accuracy and reproducibility of shrimp microbiota measurements and should be of great benefit to aquaculture microbiome research."
