In addition to reference genomes and variations between individuals, reference transcriptomes among tissues and cell types are crucial to understanding fundamental units of life and serve as a platform for developing targeted therapy in the precision medicine era.</p><p>Human Cell Atlas (HCA) consortium aims to 'create comprehensive reference maps of all human cells – as a basis for both understanding human health and diagnosing, monitoring, and treating diseases'. As part of the HCA, we are establishing the reference immune and gene expression repertoires of the Asian population under the 'Asian Immune Diversity Atlas (AIDA)' project, together with collaborators from eight countries. Asian genomic data are heavily underrepresented as compared to genomic data of people of European ancestry that accounts for 80 percent of the current data worldwide. In the AIDA project, we will rectify this imbalance by characterizing the nature and extent of variation in immune cell types from diverse Asian populations.</p><p>Within Thailand, we will investigate the conserved and unique patterns in the immune diversity of the Thai populations in different parts, which are historically, culturally, and genetically unique. These data will serve as a healthy baseline for characterizing cell state changes in various immune-related diseases. This project is a collaborative effort involving researchers from Mahidol University, Chiang Mai University, Khon Kaen University, and Prince of Songkla University in Thailand</p>"

GigaDB datasets are created by the authors with expert guidance from highly experienced data curation staff, making use of relevant standards and ensuring deposition of all relevant data in public repositories. Our curation staff keep themselves abreast of many on-going standards efforts including the GSC MIxS as well as relevant ontologies, and guide authors on their appropriate use in dataset metadata. Here I will present GigaDB and highlight some of the ways we utilise standards in our curation work."

There is now a broader and more complex spread of sequencing experiment related metadata that could usefully be collected too, due to the increasing use of sequencing technologies to study the general biological world, particularly for human health and the environment. Capturing experiment metadata information more accurately and consistently will increase the usefulness of the data, by making it more FAIR.</p><p>We are exploring experimental checklists conceptually similar to existing sample level checklists to tailor metadata provided for different ‘types’ of sequencing experiments.  We have integrated learnings from sample checklists, including the need to have checklist versioning and dependency validation. To do the initial validation for the experiment checklists, we are using: JSON, JSON schema and ELIXIR bio validation technologies. These can rapidly catch most validation issues and provide immediate feedback to users. Deeper automated validation will still be performed to ensure INSDC standards.</p><p>Currently, we have a dozen 'experiment type' checklists ranging from metabarcoding to spatial transcriptomics. These experiment type checklist JSON and accompanying JSON schema files are all driven from a single JSON configuration file. It will be straightforward and sustainable to add further experiment types. </p><p>A pilot use and submission of experiment type checklists is planned for later this year. All code and documentation is publicly accessible: <a href=https://github.com/enasequence/ena-experiment-checklist/ target=_blank>github.com/enasequence/ena-experiment-checklist/</a></p><p>In this talk, we will outline what we are doing and illustrate how it will improve the standardisation of sequence experimental metadata."

However, standard protocols and best practices for measuring shrimp microbiota are not well established, leading to uncertainty in the accuracy of results and complicating cross-study analyses.<br>In this study, we investigated the influence of key methodological variables on the gut microbiota profiles of black tiger shrimp, an important product of the aquaculture industry in Asia Pacific region. We used pooled gut samples and synthetic DNA spike-in standards to evaluate four commercial kits for DNA extraction with primer sets for the V1-V2, V3-V4, and V6-V8 hypervariable regions of the 16S rRNA gene. We evaluated the performance of the kits and PCR primers based on the diversity of observed microbiota profiles, taxon-specific biases, and accuracy of quantification of spike-in standards. We also evaluated different bioinformatics pipelines for data analysis, focusing on the advantages of using denoising algorithms compared to traditional clustering methods to resolve sequence diversity in dominant species.<br>Our results showed that the variables assessed had a significant impact on shrimp gut microbiota profiles. This highlights the need for standard protocols and best practice guidelines for measuring shrimp microbiota. Our study provides several recommendations to improve the accuracy and reproducibility of shrimp microbiota measurements and should be of great benefit to aquaculture microbiome research."
