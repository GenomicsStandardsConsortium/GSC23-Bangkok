    speaker: "Leslie Biesecker (NIH/NHGRI, USA)"
    abstract: "The rapidly falling cost of genome sequencing necessitates rethinking about how we care for patients and perform research. The clinical research paradigm has been dominated by a phenotype-first approach. In this paradigm it is the patient’s manifestations or disease that initiate the process of care, through the mechanism of the differential diagnosis. It is essential to recognize that a key function of the differential diagnostic paradigm was to narrow the range of potential diagnoses to match the limits of the then available genetic tests. Now that large panel tests can be had for $250, the upstream narrowing of the diagnoses is less critical to success in achieving the diagnosis. In fact, it can be argued that the broad testing is superior to a narrow differential as the test interrogates genes for disorders that the clinician may not have thought to considered in her differential diagnosis. Thinking more broadly than panels, clinical genome sequencing is becoming affordable and has the potential to provide a life-long health care resource for a patient. <br>In the research realm, a similar paradigm has held – that of the assembly of a patient cohort or a case-control cohort for the purpose of elucidating the cause of a disorder affecting the people of that cohort. This is an arduous and expensive process and sometimes has limited long term utility, after the primary questions have been addressed. Instead, because a research genome can cost as little as $250, one can begin to consider the establishment of genomically characterized cohorts, which can subsequently be interrogated by a genomic attribute. In this mode of research, the clinical investigator searches the genomic database to identify individuals harboring genetic variants of interest. These individuals can be recalled to the research center on the basis of their genetic change and the researcher then tests a hypothesis of that variant being associated with a phenotype. A large advantage of this approach is the reduction in bias as a part of the recruitment and eligibility review process and the reduced cost. <br>These examples and principles will be reviewed and discussed with pertinent examples."

        abstract: "With the rapid advances in genomic sequencing technology and increased knowledge of genomics in medicine, the integration of genomic data into clinical practice is becoming increasingly important. The ACMG 2015 Standards and Guidelines for the Interpretation of Sequence Variants provide a valuable framework for variant interpretation, but they also have limitations. Real-world data on the clinical significance of many variants is limited, and there are knowledge gaps in our understanding of how variants affect the disease pathogenic mechanisms and clinical phenotypes.<br>The ClinVar database is a valuable resource for variant interpretation, but it is not without its limitations. The database is not comprehensive, and the quality of the data varies. ClinGen specific gene guidelines provide additional information on the interpretation of variants in specific genes but add more complexity to interpretation process.<br>Interpretation of copy number variants (CNV) and splicing variants is particularly challenging. Changes in the number of copies or splice sites of coding sequences do not always alter the gene function. There are no clear guidelines for the interpretation of these variants, and they are often classified as 'uncertain significance.'<br>This presentation will discuss the challenges of curating clinical genomes, and the resources available to help with variant interpretation. The presentation will also discuss the future of clinical genomics, and how we can use genomic data to improve patient care."

We have integrated learnings from sample checklists, including the need to have checklist versioning and dependency validation. To do the initial validation for the experiment checklists, we are using: JSON, JSON schema and ELIXIR bio validation technologies.

        abstract: "Metabolomics, a powerful tool in systems biology, enables the characterization of phenotypes. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy plays a pivotal role in capturing dynamic changes in metabolites as a response to gene-environment interactions, diets, diseases, and stimuli. However, the NMR metabolomics pipeline is susceptible to confounding factors stemming from improper handling of biospecimens, including inadequate containers, storage conditions, and durations. These inconsistencies can introduce consequential effects that undermine accurate analysis. By utilizing NMR metabolomics, an optimized fecal sample handling strategy has been developed, leading to improved fecal metabolic phenotyping-based diagnoses. Additionally, the identification of metabolites presents another critical step in the NMR metabolomics pipeline. Misassignments of metabolites, caused by factors like human errors and the complexity of spectral data, can result in data misinterpretation and misunderstanding. To mitigate these challenges, a computational approach, specifically artificial intelligence-guided metabolite identification, is being developed. This approach aims to enhance the accuracy and precision of NMR metabolite identification, enabling more reliable data interpretation."

Techniques used to detect DNA from these sample types often involve specialized nucleic acid amplification techniques (e.g. multiple displacement amplification or primary template amplification) which can also amplify trace levels of contaminating DNA from the workflow reagents. While many new reagents and consumables are being developed, no universal standard guidelines are available to insure production or performance to maximize signal to noise (S/N).

        abstract: "Microbiome data is being generated at an unprecedented pace. In many cases, a lack of proper controls or comparison to microbiome reference materials means that important and high-impact conclusions cannot be reproduced or reliably compared to similar data sets. Microbiome standards are imperative for microbial community profiling and analysis. Whereas the microbial compositions of experimental samples are variable and often unknown, microbiome standards provide an accurate, and consistent measurement as a basis for comparison. Different Types of microbial reference materials including both whole cell and DNA mock communities, spike in controls and microbiome reference materials are useful for assessing bias at different steps of the microbiome analysis workflow."

The last year has been very busy for the CIG. We are reviewing three new MIxS checklists or extensions (Urobiome, MISIP, and MiNAS) for the upcoming MIxS v.7 release. After converting MIxS hosting to Github and LinkML (see the following talk) with the 2022 release of MIxS v.6, we have spun off a Technical Working Group (TWG) that oversees all technical aspects of MIxS, including Github issue and project tracking, LinkML coding, and creating releases. The TWG is currently working to stabilize our LinkML implementation. The CIG and TWG are working together to update GSC policies to make MIxS more sustainable and serve MIxS in a form that is machine validatable. The main GSC website (gensc.org) has undergone a major overhaul, with new content being added regularly, including links to the formal MIxS documentation generated automatically by LinkML.  Both CIG and TWG  are open and active working groups, and we are seeking new members from the GSC community who are willing to provide a few hours of work per month."

        abstract: "The Genomic Standards Consortium published the first version of the Minimum Information about any (X) Sequence standard in May 2011 (DOI:10.1038/nbt.1823). Since then, it has since been adopted, in part, into the INSDC’s requirements for describing Biosample and sequence submissions. That means that all of those records have a minimum set of required attributes and that submitters are provided with a standardized vocabulary of other terms they can use to describe their submissions.<br>The National Microbiome Data Collaborative was launched by the US Department of Energy in ~2020 with the intent of aggregating standardized metadata and results from numerous environmental omics projects (DOI:10.1038/s41579-020-0377-0). NMDC is distinctive in the fact that multiple omics modalities are supported (metagenomics, metaproteomics, metabolomics, etc.) and that the metadata conform to a formal schema with semantic web and linked data compatibility. <br>NMDC adopted many MIxS terms to describe biosamples but recognized the potential for higher levels of enforceable formality in the MIxS standard. This led to a 2020 effort to express MIxS in RDF, which has since evolved into a campaign to express MIxS in the LinkML language, which can be converted into RDF. Multiple stakeholders from NMDC and the wider GSC community have contributed to this new implementation of MIxS, which stands as a formal specification independent of any organization that may wish to implement portions of it. This was only possible because the contributors had a combination of skills and principles that included sustainable software development, schema testing with valid and invalid examples, the ability to gather user input, and an appreciation for predictable release processes."

        abstract: "Over the past decade, complementary sequence-based and culture-based approaches have provided clear, reproducible evidence that the human urinary bladder has a microbial community (the urobiome) that includes bacteria, fungi and viruses. The urobiome appears to be associated with several urological disorders in the absence of clinically identifiable infections, including kidney disease, overactive bladder, and bladder cancers. However, urobiome research has had inconsistent reporting of sampling conditions and participant-related factors, which will substantially limit reuse and secondary analyses of data collected from urobiome studies. To enable urobiome research to be Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR), consensus amongst researchers on information collected and metadata standards are needed. Towards this goal, the urobiome research community has generated a consensus statement (published in 2021) and has worked with the GSC to develop an extension of Minimum Information about any (X) Sequence (MIxS) standards."

        abstract: "Over the last two decades, with the evolving targeted therapies in the Oncology and Haematology-Oncology landscape, more cancer patients can live longer, as demonstrated in many clinical trial data on improvement in the overall survival of cancer patients. The evolvement of targeted therapies has shifted the paradigm in clinical molecular testing, leading to more sequential tests and a longer waiting time and the need for more tissues. Tissue scarcity, longer turn-around-time, and rebiopsy patients are now problems for many clinicians and pathologists around the globe, impacting the overall survival of real-world cancer patients in their treatment journey. In addition, in most developing countries, patients discovered cancers are usually in Stages III and IV onwards, which is a real battle against time. The need to democratize In-House Next-Generation-Sequencing (NGS) to improve actual personalized medicine and allows the development of local expertise in biomarker testing to support the future of precision medicine.

The Global Biodata Coalition (GBC) brings together life science research funding organisations that recognise these challenges and acknowledge the threat that the lack of sustainability poses. They agree to work together to find ways to improve sustainability.</p><p>In the presentation I will provide an overview of the global biodata resource infrastructure, focusing in particular on challenges to providing sustained long-term funding to the resources that comprise the infrastructure. Covering some of the work that GBC has carried out to understand and classify biodata resources and the entire biodata resource infrastructure, we will outline the Global Core Biodata Resource programme and Inventory project and also introduce the stakeholder consultation processes around approaches to sustainability and open data.

        abstract: "Gut microbiota play an important role in nutritional, metabolic and immunological systems. The balance of microbiological ecology in the intestine (homeostasis) is crucial for health maintenance. Dysbiosis of gut microbiota and diversity can lead to immunological disorders and associated with many diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE); a chronic autoimmune disease effecting at least five million people worldwide.<br>To study gut microbiota alteration associated with SLE, fecal samples were collected from lupus-prone mice, by chemically induced (pristane) and genetically induced (FcRIIb knockout) SLE development. We found that gut microbiota of lupus-prone mice began to change at 4 months of age, and some clinical symptoms were found significantly different compared with healthy mice beginning at 6 months after microbiota changes. Differences of physicochemical conditions in each section of and feces can affect the composition of gut microbiota, we investigated gut microbiota composition along mouse GI tract among different groups of mice at various ages.<br>Here I present our preliminary data, and suggested that gut microbiota composition was associated with SLE by increasing or decreasing of some bacteria, hence the modification of the gut microbiota, using diet, prebiotics and probiotics, might function to re-balance the composition of gut microbiota and, hopefully relieve the SLE progression in a safe manner than the immunosuppressed drug. Our ongoing experiment is to perform fecal transplant of fecal portion that was statistically denoted important to the non-SLE, as preventive and therapeutic strategies, and determine gut microbiota along clinical SLE progression, in pristane and FcRIIb knockout mice."

        abstract: "Mobile genetic elements (MGEs), which comprise viruses and plasmids, are highly abundant across all life forms, showcasing a remarkable array of genetic diversity. Their exceptional capability to mobilize is pivotal in facilitating horizontal gene transfer, a mechanism that enables the acquisition of genetic information through means other than vertical inheritance. This process fosters the exchange of genetic material among distantly related lineages, profoundly influencing evolution, ecological innovation, and the dynamics of biological communities and biogeochemical cycles. Despite their crucial role, the functional repertoire of MGEs remains largely unexplored, primarily due to a significant portion of their genes lacking known functions. Additionally, the dynamics of gene gain, loss, and exchange have not been systematically studied across large datasets.<br>I will summarize recent large scale efforts to characterize the diversity of MGEs, and discuss some ideas for the development of new genomic standards for these genetic elements. By setting up new genomic standards for MGEs, researchers can enhance our understanding of their functional significance and unravel their potential impact on various aspects of life, including evolution, ecological dynamics, and biogeochemical cycles. The development of such standards promises to open up exciting avenues for future research, making strides towards unlocking the full potential and implications of MGEs in the world of genetics and beyond."

However, the discovery of MAGs is problematics and there are no requirements to archive them in an INSDC database, and comparison of these MAG collections is hampered by the lack of uniformity in their generation, annotation and storage. To address this, we have developed MGnify Genomes, a growing collection of biome-specific microbial genome catalogues generated using MAGs and publicly available isolate genomes from a common biome. Strategies for improving these catalogues and subsequent expansion will be discussed, as well as an outline of how these can be used to contextualise new datasets."

        abstract: "Naming of microorganisms (nomenclature) is highly standardized through nomenclatural codes such as the International Code of Nomenclature of Prokaryotes (ICNP), which have rules governing how names are formed and used. By contrast, classification of microorganisms (taxonomy) is completely unregulated to ensure freedom of taxonomic opinion. This is due in part to the recognition that taxonomy could become methodologically outdated if fixed in time. However, we have entered the age of genome-based taxonomy, and genomes are the most fundamental blueprints of life making it unlikely that a widely accepted alternative methodology resulting in a radically different and improved taxonomy will be developed. I suggest that now is the time to adopt a standardized taxonomic framework based on comparative analysis of genome sequences, or at least we should establish a primary taxonomic reference ('Tassonomia Franca') that will facilitate unambiguous scientific communication of microbial diversity."
