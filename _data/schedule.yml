As part of the HCA, we are establishing the reference immune and gene expression repertoires of the Asian population under the 'Asian Immune Diversity Atlas (AIDA)' project, together with collaborators from eight countries. Asian genomic data are heavily underrepresented as compared to genomic data of people of European ancestry that accounts for 80 percent of the current data worldwide. In the AIDA project, we will rectify this imbalance by characterizing the nature and extent of variation in immune cell types from diverse Asian populations.</p><p>Within Thailand, we will investigate the conserved and unique patterns in the immune diversity of the Thai populations in different parts, which are historically, culturally, and genetically unique. These data will serve as a healthy baseline for characterizing cell state changes in various immune-related diseases.

There is now a broader and more complex spread of sequencing experiment related metadata that could usefully be collected too, due to the increasing use of sequencing technologies to study the general biological world, particularly for human health and the environment. Capturing experiment metadata information more accurately and consistently will increase the usefulness of the data, by making it more FAIR.</p><p>We are exploring experimental checklists conceptually similar to existing sample level checklists to tailor metadata provided for different ‘types’ of sequencing experiments.  We have integrated learnings from sample checklists, including the need to have checklist versioning and dependency validation. To do the initial validation for the experiment checklists, we are using: JSON, JSON schema and ELIXIR bio validation technologies. These can rapidly catch most validation issues and provide immediate feedback to users. Deeper automated validation will still be performed to ensure INSDC standards.</p><p>Currently, we have a dozen 'experiment type' checklists ranging from metabarcoding to spatial transcriptomics. These experiment type checklist JSON and accompanying JSON schema files are all driven from a single JSON configuration file. It will be straightforward and sustainable to add further experiment types. </p><p>A pilot use and submission of experiment type checklists is planned for later this year. All code and documentation is publicly accessible: <a href=https://github.com/enasequence/ena-experiment-checklist/ target=_blank>github.com/enasequence/ena-experiment-checklist/</a></p><p>In this talk, we will outline what we are doing and illustrate how it will improve the standardisation of sequence experimental metadata."

However, standard protocols and best practices for measuring shrimp microbiota are not well established, leading to uncertainty in the accuracy of results and complicating cross-study analyses.<br>In this study, we investigated the influence of key methodological variables on the gut microbiota profiles of black tiger shrimp, an important product of the aquaculture industry in Asia Pacific region. We used pooled gut samples and synthetic DNA spike-in standards to evaluate four commercial kits for DNA extraction with primer sets for the V1-V2, V3-V4, and V6-V8 hypervariable regions of the 16S rRNA gene. We evaluated the performance of the kits and PCR primers based on the diversity of observed microbiota profiles, taxon-specific biases, and accuracy of quantification of spike-in standards. We also evaluated different bioinformatics pipelines for data analysis, focusing on the advantages of using denoising algorithms compared to traditional clustering methods to resolve sequence diversity in dominant species.<br>Our results showed that the variables assessed had a significant impact on shrimp gut microbiota profiles. This highlights the need for standard protocols and best practice guidelines for measuring shrimp microbiota. Our study provides several recommendations to improve the accuracy and reproducibility of shrimp microbiota measurements and should be of great benefit to aquaculture microbiome research."

The TWG is currently working to stabilize our LinkML implementation. The CIG and TWG are working together to update GSC policies to make MIxS more sustainable and serve MIxS in a form that is machine validatable.

        abstract: "The Genomic Standards Consortium published the first version of the Minimum Information about any (X) Sequence standard in May 2011 (DOI:10.1038/nbt.1823). Since then, it has since been adopted, in part, into the INSDC’s requirements for describing Biosample and sequence submissions. That means that all of those records have a minimum set of required attributes and that submitters are provided with a standardized vocabulary of other terms they can use to describe their submissions.<br>The National Microbiome Data Collaborative was launched by the US Department of Energy in ~2020 with the intent of aggregating standardized metadata and results from numerous environmental omics projects (DOI:10.1038/s41579-020-0377-0). NMDC is distinctive in the fact that multiple omics modalities are supported (metagenomics, metaproteomics, metabolomics, etc.) and that the metadata conform to a formal schema with semantic web and linked data compatibility. <br>NMDC adopted many MIxS terms to describe biosamples but recognized the potential for higher levels of enforceable formality in the MIxS standard. This led to a 2020 effort to express MIxS in RDF, which has since evolved into a campaign to express MIxS in the LinkML language, which can be converted into RDF. Multiple stakeholders from NMDC and the wider GSC community have contributed to this new implementation of MIxS, which stands as a formal specification independent of any organization that may wish to implement portions of it. This was only possible because the contributors had a combination of skills and principles that included sustainable software development, schema testing with valid and invalid examples, the ability to gather user input, and an appreciation for predictable release processes."

      - title: "How do you achieve standards in taxonomy when taxonomic freedom is paramount?"
        link: ""
        abstract: "Naming of microorganisms (nomenclature) is highly standardized through nomenclatural codes such as the International Code of Nomenclature of Prokaryotes (ICNP), which have rules governing how names are formed and used. By contrast, classification of microorganisms (taxonomy) is completely unregulated to ensure freedom of taxonomic opinion. This is due in part to the recognition that taxonomy could become methodologically outdated if fixed in time. However, we have entered the age of genome-based taxonomy, and genomes are the most fundamental blueprints of life making it unlikely that a widely accepted alternative methodology resulting in a radically different and improved taxonomy will be developed. I suggest that now is the time to adopt a standardized taxonomic framework based on comparative analysis of genome sequences, or at least we should establish a primary taxonomic reference ('Tassonomia Franca') that will facilitate unambiguous scientific communication of microbial diversity."
