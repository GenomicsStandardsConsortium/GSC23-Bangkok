                <p>Coronavirus (COVID-19) remains a serious health risk. While we hope that no further restrictions will be enforced we cannot guarentee that to be the case. In the event that we are unable to proceed with the in-person conference as planned, we reserve the right to vary, suspend, postpone or cancel the conference. We will not be liable for any attendees travel, accomodation or other expenses associated with the meeting. Please see our <a href="https://genomicsstandardsconsortium.github.io/GSC23-Bangkok/terms.html">terms and conditions.</a></p>
